### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**csulva/csulva** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Flask webapp
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flask
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything data related
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with my portfolio
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Gmail
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can teach you a fun fact about any movie with a few clicks on my keyboard thanks to Python.
  For example: No Time To Die is the first James Bond movie to feature all the characters of Q, Felix Leiter, Miss Moneypenny, and M since Licence to Kill (1989), which is an interval of about thirty-one years.
